# 📌 Phishing Email Analysis 

This README explains how to identify phishing emails using a real example email that pretended to be from **Deloitte** but was actually sent from **fresherjobsz.com**.  
The goal is to teach beginners how to analyze phishing emails confidently.

---

# 🟦 1. What is a Phishing Email? 

A **phishing email** is a fake message designed to trick you into:

- Clicking a dangerous link  
- Giving personal information (resume, phone number, login credentials, bank details)  
- Downloading harmful attachments  
- Believing false claims (job offer, warnings, urgent alerts)

Attackers make the email look professional so users trust it.

Phishing = **Deception + Social Engineering**

# 🟦 2. Screenshot of the Email Body

### What we see in the screenshot:

- The title: **Deloitte – Analyst Trainee Recruitment**  
- Highlighted job information  
- Big orange **Upload Resume & Apply** button  
- Generic greeting: “Dear Candidate”

This looks convincing, but contains many red flags.

# 🟦 3. Examine the Sender’s Email Address (Spoofing Check)

### Expected REAL Deloitte emails:
✔ `@deloitte.com`  
✔ `@deloitte.co.in`

### Actual sender:
❌ `support@fresherjobsz.com`

The email CLAIMS to be from Deloitte, but the sender domain belongs to a completely different website.

➡️ **Sender domain mismatch is one of the biggest phishing signs.**

---

# 🟦 4. Email Header Analysis (Understanding Each Field)

---

## 🟩 Understanding Each Header Field 

### ✔ Message ID
A unique ID generated by the sending server.  
Not important for phishing detection.

---

### ✔ From
`Fresher Jobs <support@fresherjobsz.com>`

The “From” field can be faked easily.  
The domain does not match Deloitte.

---

### ✔ SPF: PASS  
SPF checks if the sending IP is allowed to send emails for that domain.

Example:

```
PASS with IP 45.143.132.212
```

⚠ **IMPORTANT:**  
SPF PASS only verifies that the sender is allowed to send mail for **fresherjobsz.com**, NOT that it is Deloitte.

Attackers can set SPF on their malicious domains.

➡️ SPF PASS ≠ safe email.

---

### ✔ DKIM: PASS (Signed by msnd3.com)

DKIM verifies digital signatures.

But here it's signed by **msnd3.com**, not fresherjobsz.com or Deloitte.

➡️ This proves a **third-party mailer** or mass-mail tool sent the message.  
➡️ DKIM mismatch = suspicious.

---

### ✔ DMARC: PASS
DMARC checks alignment between SPF/DKIM.

A PASS only means the attacker configured their own domain properly.

➡️ DMARC PASS does NOT validate the job offer as real.

---

### ✔ Mailer: Msnd Mailer v8.x.x
This is bulk-mail software.

Real Deloitte HR does NOT use mass-mail tools to contact candidates.

➡️ Another red flag.

---

# 🟦 5. Suspicious Link in the Email

Your button opened this URL:

```
https://freshers.info/question.php?ID=519&title=Deloitte-Recruitment
```

### Why this is dangerous:

❌ It is NOT Deloitte's official website  
❌ Freshers.info is a third‑party page unrelated to Deloitte  
❌ Could steal resumes or redirect you to unsafe pages  
❌ Common technique in job phishing scams  

Real Deloitte links look like:

✔ https://jobs.deloitte.com/  
✔ https://careers.deloitte.com/

➡️ **Link domain mismatch is a MAJOR warning sign.**

---

# 🟦 6. Look for Urgent or Manipulative Language

Phishing emails use urgency to force quick action.

This email uses:

> “Upload Resume & Apply”

It pushes the victim to act immediately without thinking.

➡️ This is classic social engineering.

---

# 🟦 7. Check for Mismatched URLs 

Brand shown → **Deloitte**  
Actual link → **freshers.info**  
Sender domain → **fresherjobsz.com**

None of them match.

➡️ This proves the email is not legitimate.

---

# 🟦 8. Grammar, Tone, and Style Check

- Generic greeting: **Dear Candidate**  
- No personalization  
- Simple, unprofessional tone  
- No HR signature  
- Missing confidentiality footer  

Real Deloitte emails always use:

✔ Your full name  
✔ Professional formatting  
✔ Official HR signatures  

➡️ This email lacks all professional elements.
